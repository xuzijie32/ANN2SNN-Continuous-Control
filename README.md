### Error Amplification Limits ANN-to-SNN Conversion in Continuous Control
Zijie Xu, Zihan Huang, Yiting Dong, Kang Chen, Wenxuan Liu, Zhaofei Yu

## Setup
The Conda environments can be found in `./environments`. Note that the MuJoCo tasks (Python=3.7) and DMC tasks (Python=3.8) use different environments.

## Well-trained Models
The models are stored in `./MuJoCo/models` for DDPG/TD3/SAC agents trained for 3M steps. The pretrained DrQ-v2 models are provided in this [GitHub Release](https://github.com/xuzijie32/ANN2SNN-CRPI/releases/tag/Models) (`exp_local.zip`), the checkpoints should be located at `DMC/exp_local/<task_name>/snapshot.pt`. You can convert them directly without re-training the ANNs. You can also see these models in [`Hugging Face`](https://huggingface.co/Zijie-Xu/ANN-SNN_Continuous_Control).

You can also train the ANN models on MuJoCo tasks by running:
```
python DDPG.py --env Hopper-v4 --seed 0
python TD3.py --env Hopper-v4 --seed 0
python SAC.py --env Hopper-v4 --seed 0
```
Or train the ANN models on DMC tasks by running:
```
export MUJOCO_GL=egl
python train.py task@_global_=cartpole_swingup
```

## Converting to SNNs with IF Neurons


Experiments on MuJoCo can be run with:
```
python convert.py --policy_name DDPG --env Hopper-v4 --SNN_ts 16 --eval_seed 0
```
The original ANN policy `--policy_name` can be "DDPG", "TD3", or "SAC". The environment `--env` can be "Ant-v4", "HalfCheetah-v4", "Hopper-v4", or "Walker2d-v4". Running this command will output a .npy file of size `[11][10]`, including 11 different values of $\alpha$: $0,0.1,0.2,\cdots,0.9,1$, and 10 trajectory returns. 


Experiments on DMC can be run with:
```
export MUJOCO_GL=egl
python convert.py --env cartpole_swingup --SNN_ts 32 --seed 0
```
The environment `--env` can be "cartpole_swingup", "finger_spin", "reacher_easy", "cheetah_run", "acrobot_swingup", or "quadruped_walk". Running this command will output a .npy file of size `[11]`, including the average returns for 11 different values of $\alpha$: $0,0.1,0.2,\cdots,0.9,1$. 

Note that some environments are noisy and require multiple runs to obtain more reliable and clearer trends, as reported in the paper: `All results are averaged over five random seeds. For each seed, we evaluate the policy over ten rollout episodes of up to 1,000 interaction steps (terminated earlier if the episode ends), yielding a total of 50,000 environment steps per method.`
